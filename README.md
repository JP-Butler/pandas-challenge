Analysis Summary-
    The following analysis uses the Python library Pandas to clean, organize and manipulate the raw data of a city's school district. Utilizing the school and student data of said district to reach clear conclusions on the standardized testing results of the student's reading and math scores and school budgets to name a few. Through several Pandas functions such as but not limited to : DataFrame creation, loc/iloc, merging, grouping, binning and mapping data. Well organized and visually clear DataFrames were created to showcase the test results of the students. Breaking down the results by several measures such as: results by grade, by district, highest and lowest perfrorming schools, scores by school size and spending per student.
 
Analysis Conclusions-
   Some conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis are that Charter School students on average have much higher test scores than District School students. This is exhibited clearly by the final DataFrame of the Analysis, school_summary in the "Scores by School Type" section. Showing both higher average math and reading scores and significantly higher percentages of students passing reading and math. As well as a substantially greater overal passing percentage, in fact Charter Schools have an approximately 1.68 times greater overall passing percentage than District Schools (90.43% over 53.67%). One could argue due to the smaller school sizes (by student count) of Charter Schools compared to District Schools, Charter students receive more attention and help leading to higher test scores.
   Another conclusion we can reach is that spending per student does not equate to higher test scores. The spending_summary DataFrame in the "Scores by School Summary" section of the analysis clearly shows this. In fact reading and math scores, percentage of students passing reading, math and overall progressively get worse the more money that is spent per student.
   To conclude, it is clear future priorities must be directed towards the District Schools if average test scores are to be increased. Although as the analysis shows the answer cannot be to solely to allocate more money towards them. A multi-factor strategy will be needed to level the testing disparity between the school types.

Challenge Overview
    
   In this challenge I played the role of a Data Scientist for a school district. Tasked with analyzing the raw data for all their schools budgets, sizes amongst others. As well as the standardized test scores of their students in reading and math. To provide the school board and local government with clear trends and patterns that will help them with future budget creation and resource prioritization. This was accomplished by using the Pandas Python library DataFrame creation function and various manipulation tools to showcase visually clear data tables displaying the results in easily comparable formats.
